# Tasks: Lightstack CLI Core Foundation

**Status**: ✅ CLOSED (2025-10-09)

## Outcome

Spec 001 generated 100+ tasks. We completed approximately 60% before realizing:
1. Scope was too large for single spec
2. We needed a separate backlog (GitHub issues)
3. Smaller, focused specs ship faster

**What shipped**: See [spec.md](spec.md)
**What's deferred**: See GitHub issues #4-#16

## Lessons Learned

### Spec Management
- ❌ **Don't**: Create 100+ task specs in one branch
- ✅ **Do**: Break into 10-15 task increments, ship often
- ✅ **Do**: Use GitHub issues for long-term backlog

### Task Tracking
- ❌ **Don't**: Use tasks.md as project backlog
- ✅ **Do**: Use tasks.md only for current spec scope
- ✅ **Do**: Create GitHub issues for everything else

### Testing Strategy
- ❌ **Don't**: Write Docker-dependent tests (testing Docker, not our code)
- ✅ **Do**: Test command building, config generation, validation logic
- ✅ **Do**: Manual testing for Docker integration
