# Implementation Plan: Lightstack CLI Core Foundation

**Branch**: `001-initial-lightstack-cli`
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: ✅ MERGED (2025-10-09)

## Status: CLOSED

This spec has been closed and merged to main. See [spec.md](spec.md) for what shipped vs what was deferred.

## Actual Outcomes

### What We Built
- **Core CLI structure**: Commander.js with proper command hierarchy
- **Config management**: Cosmiconfig + Zod validation
- **Docker orchestration**: Complete Supabase stack generation
- **SSL integration**: mkcert (dev) + Let's Encrypt config scaffolding (prod)
- **Environment management**: Multi-target deployment configuration
- **Smart defaults**: Auto-detect Supabase config, use existing ports
- **Error handling**: Actionable messages with cause/solution format

### Architecture Decisions That Stuck
1. **File-based Traefik routing** - More debuggable than Docker labels
2. **Proxy to Supabase CLI in dev** - Don't wrap, orchestrate
3. **Test what we own** - Unit tests for logic, not Docker behavior
4. **GitOps deployment model** - git checkout + light up (not file transfer)

### Architecture Decisions That Changed
1. **TDD approach** - Started with Docker-dependent contract tests, pivoted to unit-test-heavy approach
2. **Scope management** - Started with 100+ task spec, learned to ship smaller increments
3. **Dev vs deployment modes** - Realized these need clearer separation (see Spec 002)

### Technical Stack (Final)
- **Language**: TypeScript/Node.js 20+
- **Package Manager**: Bun
- **CLI Framework**: Commander.js
- **Config**: Cosmiconfig + Zod
- **Docker**: Shell out to `docker compose`
- **SSL**: Traefik + mkcert (dev) / Let's Encrypt (prod scaffolding)
- **Testing**: Vitest (unit tests only, no Docker-dependent tests)

## Original Plan (Reference)

This was the initial implementation plan. What actually shipped is documented above.

### Phase 0: Research ✅
- Researched Docker Compose orchestration patterns
- Evaluated Traefik vs Caddy (chose Traefik for DNS provider support)
- Studied Supabase self-hosting docs
- Decided on mkcert + Traefik for SSL

### Phase 1: Design ✅
- Created data model (Project, Environment, Service entities)
- Designed CLI command contracts
- Planned file generation strategy

### Phase 2: Tasks ✅ (Partially)
- Generated 100+ tasks (too many!)
- Completed ~60% before realizing scope was too large
- Remaining tasks moved to GitHub issues

### Phase 3-4: Implementation ✅ (What Shipped)
See [spec.md](spec.md) for actual deliverables

**Retrospective**: Spec 001 was valuable for establishing foundation, but taught us to ship smaller increments. Future specs will be tighter in scope.

**Next**: See [Spec 002](../002-dev-deployment-separation/) for continuation.
