## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]

   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working with Supabase, I need a CLI tool that enables me to self-host my entire Supabase stack (database, auth, API, storage) both locally and in production, escaping Supabase's vendor pricing and high costs while maintaining perfect dev/prod parity and complete data sovereignty.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new project folder with Supabase initialized, **When** developer runs initialization command, **Then** the CLI creates configuration for self-hosted Supabase stack with production-grade SSL
2. **Given** an initialized Lightstack project, **When** developer runs development command, **Then** complete self-hosted Supabase stack starts (PostgreSQL, Auth, API, Storage, Studio) with HTTPS proxy
3. **Given** a project with self-hosted Supabase, **When** developer deploys to production, **Then** identical Supabase stack deploys to remote server with Let's Encrypt SSL
4. **Given** a production deployment, **When** deployment completes, **Then** all Supabase services accessible via HTTPS with automatic health checks and rollback capability
5. **Given** a need to escape Supabase vendor costs, **When** developer switches from hosted Supabase to self-hosted, **Then** data migration and identical functionality preserved

### Edge Cases
- **Docker not available**: System shows clear error message with Docker installation instructions and exits gracefully
- **Port conflicts**: System detects user-configured ports from Supabase config.toml and automatically uses those instead of defaults, preventing conflicts when users have customized their Supabase ports
- **Partial service failures during orchestration**: System attempts graceful shutdown of started services and provides detailed failure diagnostics
- **SSL certificate generation fails**: System falls back to self-signed certificates in development with warning, fails deployment in production with clear error
- **Conflicting configurations**: Lightstack configuration takes precedence with warning about overrides displayed to user
- **Network interruption during deployment**: System retries with exponential backoff (3 attempts), preserves partial progress where possible
- **Insufficient disk space**: Pre-flight checks detect and warn before starting operations
- **Invalid credentials/tokens**: System validates early and provides clear instructions for obtaining/configuring credentials
- **Corrupted project state**: System provides recovery command to reset to known good state
- **Concurrent CLI operations**: System uses lock files to prevent conflicting operations on same project

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: ‚úÖ System MUST provide single command to start complete development environment

- **FR-007**: ‚úÖ System MUST manage secrets securely between environments

### Self-Hosted Supabase Requirements *(core value proposition)*
- **FR-022**: ‚úÖ System MUST support self-hosted Supabase stack deployment (PostgreSQL, Auth, API, Storage, Studio) - Supabase is required, not optional
- **FR-023**: ‚úÖ System MUST provide identical Supabase stack in development and production environments
- **FR-024**: ‚úÖ System MUST enable cost-effective alternative to hosted Supabase pricing ($25-$2900/month hosted ‚Üí $20-200/month self-hosted)
- **FR-025**: ‚úÖ System MUST preserve complete data sovereignty (user's servers, user's database)
- **FR-026**: ‚è≥ System MUST support migration from hosted Supabase to self-hosted Supabase
- **FR-027**: ‚úÖ System MUST handle PostgreSQL data persistence in production with backup strategies
- **FR-028**: ‚úÖ System MUST integrate Supabase CLI migration system for schema management
- **FR-029**: ‚è≥ System MUST support GitOps deployment (deploy via git tags, not file transfer)
- **FR-030**: System MAY support other BaaS platforms (PocketBase, Appwrite) in the future if demand exists (YAGNI principle)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project Configuration**: Represents project-specific settings including local development options, deployment targets, and service configurations
- **Deployment Target**: Represents a destination environment with host information, domain configuration, and SSL settings
- **Environment Variables**: Represents secrets and configuration values specific to each deployment environment
- **Service**: Represents an orchestrated component (frontend, Supabase services, database) with dependencies and startup requirements
- **SSL Certificate**: Represents security credentials for HTTPS support in both development and production

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-002**: Error messages MUST be developer-friendly - technically accurate yet comprehensible and actionable for beginners
- **NFR-003**: System MUST provide clear remediation steps for common error scenarios
- **NFR-004**: CLI output MUST be English-only (no internationalization required)
- **NFR-005**: All user-facing messages MUST be centrally managed for consistency

## Notes and Clarifications Needed

All initial clarifications have been resolved based on user feedback:
- Docker is a hard requirement (no fallbacks needed for early-stage apps)
- Let's Encrypt is sufficient for SSL certificates
- Auto-browser opening has been removed from requirements
- Rollbacks will be automatic on deployment failure
- No specific performance metrics needed at this stage
- Scale is appropriate for early-stage Nuxt/Supabase apps
