# Specification Quality Checklist: Separate Development and Deployment Workflows

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Validation Notes**:
- Spec focuses on WHAT (proxy mode vs full stack, app containerization) and WHY (fast iteration vs deployment parity) without specifying HOW
- All sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies, Out of Scope
- Language is accessible (e.g., "developer needs to run X and have it do Y" rather than "implement function Z")
- Terminology is precise: uses "deployment environment" / "deployment mode" / "non-development environment" rather than conflating with "production"

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Validation Notes**:
- No NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers present
- All 20 functional requirements are testable (use concrete verbs like "MUST detect", "MUST start", "MUST generate")
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (5 seconds, 60 seconds, 100%, zero conflicts)
- Success criteria focus on user outcomes (e.g., "Developer can start environment" not "Function returns status code")
- 12 acceptance scenarios across 4 user stories provide complete coverage
- 5 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries (no remote SSH, no CI/CD, etc.)
- Dependencies section lists all prerequisites from Spec 001
- Assumptions section documents expectations about user setup
- FR-020 improves architecture by using `docker-compose.deployment.yml` (not `production.yml`) to clarify it applies to ALL non-development environments

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Validation Notes**:
- Each of 20 FRs maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- 4 user stories with priorities (P1, P2, P2, P3) cover the complete workflow separation
- User Story 1 (P1) is MVP for development mode
- User Stories 2-3 (P2) complete deployment mode (for ANY non-development environment, not just production)
- User Story 4 (P3) is UX polish
- All SCs are achievable with the defined FRs (development speed, deployment parity for any target, correct guidance)
- Spec stays in problem space (modes, workflows, configurations) not solution space (specific functions, classes, file structures)
- Terminology correctly distinguishes "deployment environments" (staging, production, etc.) from "development environment"

## Notes

✅ **ALL ITEMS PASS** - Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`

**Strengths**:
- Clear separation of concerns between development and deployment modes
- Prioritized user stories enable MVP-first implementation
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Strong grounding in real issue (#17) and existing implementation context (Spec 001, deployment-flow.md)
- Success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- Architectural improvement: Renaming `docker-compose.production.yml` → `docker-compose.deployment.yml` clarifies the two-mode design (dev vs deployment, not per-environment files)
- Precise terminology throughout: "deployment environment/mode" for any non-development target (staging, production, qa, etc.)

**Recommendations for Planning Phase**:
- Review current `up.ts:48-266` to understand refactoring scope
- Examine Dockerfile generation patterns from other CLI tools (e.g., `npx create-next-app` Dockerfile output)
- Consider test strategy for mode detection and branching logic (unit tests for mode selection, contract tests for file generation)
